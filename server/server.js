// make this a simple http server that writes to the response stream object

// the page should display the following message:

// Today is <day name>, <month name> <date>. Here are the available food trucks:

// list the food trucks returned by filterByDay, passing in the current day name.
// e.g. filterByDay(day); where "day" is determined using the enhancedDate module
// The list of trucks returned will be an array of food truck objects. Iterate 
// through the list, building up a string of food truck names. Once you're done 
// iterating through that list, display the string you built up.

// Remember that the response is a stream object that must be closed.
